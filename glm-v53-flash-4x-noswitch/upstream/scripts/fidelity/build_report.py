"""Build the fidelity campaign report: docs/fidelity/REPORT.md and report.html.

Reads the public aggregates only: docs/fidelity/metrics-v2/*.json, corpus-summary.json,
boots/*.json, optional task results (metrics/tasks-*.json) and corruption-probe summaries
(metrics/corruption-*.json), voxel checks
(voxel/checks.json), the figure index plots/plots.json with its SVG files, and an
optional hand-written verdict (verdict.md; absent means the verdict is "pending"), and an optional
plain-language summary (eli5.md) shown above it.
The HTML file is self-contained: inline CSS, figures as inline SVG, no scripts and no
external requests, light and dark themes, readable at phone width.

After writing, a leak check scans the report and the figure SVGs for absolute user
paths, private corpus paths, IPv4 addresses, corpus window ids and, when the ignored
site files exist, the site's hostnames and addresses and the corpus project names. A
finding names the category and file only and fails the build (exit 2).
