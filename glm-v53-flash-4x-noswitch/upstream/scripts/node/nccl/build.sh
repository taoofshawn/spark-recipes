# build.sh — rebuild the patched NCCL from the vendored sources, on a node, from the
# workstation. It reproduces `~/nccl-patched/libnccl.so.2` (scripts/node/nccl/README.md) from a
# fresh clone of NVIDIA/nccl at the pinned tag plus the vendored overlay patch, compiled for
# GB10 (sm_121) inside a throwaway container so the node stays clean.
#
# Everything happens on the remote host over ssh; nothing is built on the workstation, and
# nothing is distributed (that is scripts/node/nccl/install-nccl.sh's job).
#
# Usage: scripts/node/nccl/build.sh [--host <alias>] [--dest <dir>] [--jobs N] [--dry-run]
#   --host <alias>   ssh alias of the build node (default: rank 1 of NODES in cluster.env)
#   --dest <dir>     build directory on the node (default: $HOME/nccl-build-repro, expanded
#                    ON THE NODE). It must NOT resolve to ~/nccl-build: that is the original
#                    tree of the deployed library and this script refuses to touch it.
#   --jobs N         make parallelism (default: 20)
#   --dry-run        print exactly the commands the real run would execute, in the same
#                    order, and execute none of them (no ssh at all)
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 build/verification failure · 2 usage error.
#
# The artifact stays on the node at <dest>/nccl/build/lib/libnccl.so.2 and is compared with
# scripts/node/nccl/SHA256SUMS and expected.env (sha, size, dynamic symbol count). The
# rebuild is NOT bit-reproducible: a differing sha is a WARNING, not an error.
