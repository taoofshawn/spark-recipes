# install-nccl.sh — fan the patched NCCL library out to the 4 nodes, from the workstation.
# It copies <build host>:<path>/libnccl.so.2 into $NCCL_DIR (cluster.env, ~/nccl-patched) on
# every target. The launcher preloads exactly that file (scripts/launcher/launch-glm53-tp4.sh:
# -v $NCCL_DIR:/opt/patched-nccl:ro, LD_PRELOAD=/opt/patched-nccl/libnccl.so.2), so a wrong
# or truncated library breaks all four ranks at once. Two safeguards follow from that:
#
#   * nothing is copied unless the SOURCE sha is the expected one (--force to override);
#   * the install is ATOMIC per node: the file lands as <dest>.new, is chmod'ed and
#     sha-verified THERE, and only then replaces the live library with `mv -f`. Any failure
#     removes the .new and leaves the previous library untouched — an interrupted transfer
#     can never leave a half-written libnccl.so.2 behind.
#
# Data path: the file is staged on the workstation ONCE and pushed from there, unlike
# scripts/fetch-fp8-weights.sh which fans 306 GiB out node-to-node. Reason: the node-to-node
# ssh mesh only exists FROM rank 0 (scripts/bootstrap-node.sh phase 4), the build host is
# normally rank 1, and 59 MiB over mgmt costs seconds.
#
# Usage: scripts/node/nccl/install-nccl.sh [--from <host>:<path>] [--to "<alias> ..."]
#                                  [--expect-sha <sha256>] [--force] [--dry-run]
#   --from <host>:<path>   source, default <rank 1 of NODES>:~/nccl-build-repro/nccl/build/lib/libnccl.so.2 (build.sh's dest)
#   --to "<alias> ..."     target ssh aliases, default TP4_HOSTS or NODES from cluster.env
#                          (all 4). Repeatable, and one argument may hold several aliases.
#   --expect-sha <sha>     expected sha256 (64 lowercase hex), default = the libnccl.so.2
#                          line of scripts/node/nccl/SHA256SUMS
#   --force                install a library whose sha differs (prints a warning); needed
#                          after scripts/node/nccl/build.sh, which is not bit-reproducible
#   --dry-run              print every command, run nothing
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 transfer/verification failure · 2 usage error.
# The library is installed mode 0644: the launcher only reads it, it is loaded through
# LD_PRELOAD, it is never executed.
