# Container patches

These Python files change engine behavior without rebuilding the image. They are
deployed to `~/patches/`; a patch becomes active only when the launcher or
`EXTRA_DOCKER_ENV` mounts it.

| File | Role | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `../sparse_attn_indexer_kpool_sm121.py` | Apache-2.0-derived SM121 sparse-attention K-pool fix | deployed as `~/patches/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool.py` and mounted by the launcher only for the September 11 configuration (`SPARKCACHE_MODE=off`) |
| `adaptive_k_scheduler.py` | frozen previous adaptive speculative verification scheduler, retained for rollback | historical recipes mount it at `/opt/tp4/adaptive_k_scheduler.py`, added to `PYTHONPATH`, and selected by `--scheduler-cls` in `cluster.env` |
| `test_adaptive_k_policy.py` | CPU-only policy and observation-gate tests | workstation only; `scripts/deploy.sh` skips `test_*.py` |

The current defaults mount the measured scheduler at
[`../experiments/e03/draft-budget/adaptive_k_scheduler.py`](../experiments/e03/draft-budget/adaptive_k_scheduler.py).
It preserves the original policy and caps placeholders by the producing output's
engine budget. Its flag, source pin and complete previous-base rollback are in
`cluster.env.example`; the original module here keeps its historical bytes and hash.

The scheduler tracks each request's acceptance history and chooses the configured low
or high verify length. The dynamic speculation table captures CUDA-graph families for
both. It derives from the pinned vLLM `AsyncScheduler` interface and disables the
optimization if that path is unavailable. Exceptions in policy logic fall back to base
scheduling rather than stopping the endpoint.

`EXTRA_DOCKER_ENV` also carries the tuned MoE, engine override, SparkCache and SIRCL
mounts. A scheduler rollback must remove
its class flag, mount, `PYTHONPATH`, policy variables, and coupled speculative settings
while preserving all unrelated entries. See [`docs/operations.md`](../../../docs/operations.md).

```sh
python3 scripts/node/patches/test_adaptive_k_policy.py
```

The design and current behavior are summarized in
[`docs/production-recipe.md`](../../../docs/production-recipe.md). Derived files keep
their SPDX and provenance headers; licensing details are in
[`CREDITS.md`](../../../CREDITS.md).
